Delete local git branches (in the current directory) that have a remote tracking branch that is `: gone`.

## Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
$ brew tap drewwyatt/tap
$ brew install gitclean
```

## Usage

```bash
$ gitclean # executes "git branch -d" on ": gone" branches
```

**With force delete:**

```bash
$ gitclean -f # same as above, but with "-D" instead of "-d"
# or
$ gitclean --force
```

**Interactive**

Present all ": gone" branches in a checkbox list, allowing user to opt-in to deletions.

```bash
$ gitclean -i
# or
$ gitclean --interactive
# with force:
$ gitclean -if
# or
$ gitclean --interactive --force
```
